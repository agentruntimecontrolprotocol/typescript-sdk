# lease_revocation

Warehouse DB admin agent. Reads against pre-granted tables run free.
INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / DDL trigger a synchronous
`permission.request` scoped to the specific table and operation.

## Before ARCP

Two failure modes: (1) the agent has a write-capable DB role and
operators audit Slack, hoping; (2) writes go through a separate
"approval" service that the agent doesn't actually understand —
when approval is denied, the agent gets a 403 with no structure
and either gives up or retries blindly.

## With ARCP

```ts
async function authorize(client: ARCPClient, sql: string, leases: Leases): Promise<string> {
  const klass = classify(sql);              // node-sql-parser: read / write / ddl
  for (const table of klass.tables) {
    await requestLease(client, {            // permission.request → operator
      permission: `db.${klass.op}`,
      table,
      operation: klass.op,
      seconds: klass.op === "read" ? READ_LEASE_SECONDS : WRITE_LEASE_SECONDS,
      reason: "...",
    });
  }
  return klass.op;
}
```

Granted leases are cached. Mid-statement `lease.revoked` drops the
cache entry so the next call re-prompts.

## ARCP primitives

- Permission challenge — RFC §15.4.
- Full lease lifecycle (request, grant, use, refresh, revoke) —
  §15.5.
- `PERMISSION_DENIED` / `LEASE_EXPIRED` / `LEASE_REVOKED` — §18.2.

## File tour

- `main.ts` — opens session, bootstraps reads, runs two queries.
- `sql.ts` — node-sql-parser-based read/write/ddl classifier.

## Variations

- Replace operator approval with a policy engine (Cedar, OPA) — the
  responder is interchangeable as long as it emits `lease.granted`.
- Promote read leases to row-level by encoding row-filter SQL into
  `resource` (`table:public.orders/region=us`).
- Stream every DDL into [subscriptions](../subscriptions)
  for change history.
