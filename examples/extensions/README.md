# extensions

Reference for ARCP §21. Defines four extension messages
(`arcpx.sdr.tune.v1`, `arcpx.sdr.gain.v1`, `arcpx.sdr.capture.v1`,
`arcpx.sdr.demodulate.v1`) for software-defined radio. Capture and
demodulate return artifact refs. Demonstrates correct unknown-message
handling.

## Before ARCP

SDR control over a domain-specific RPC (gqrx remote, hamlib's
`rigctld`) that the rest of the agent stack doesn't speak. No trace
context, no typed errors, no observability story.

## With ARCP

```ts
// tune → gain → capture → demodulate, all over one envelope shape
await request(client, buildEnvelope({ ..., type: EXT_TUNE, payload: {...} }));
await request(client, buildEnvelope({ ..., type: EXT_GAIN, payload: {...} }));
const capture = await request(client, buildEnvelope({ ..., type: EXT_CAPTURE, payload: {...} }));
const audio   = await request(client, buildEnvelope({ ..., type: EXT_DEMODULATE,
    payload: { iq_artifact_id: capture.payload.artifact_id, ... } }));
```

The IQ buffer never travels inline — it lives at an `artifact_id`
the demodulate call references. The runtime advertises which
extension messages it accepts; clients refuse the session if the
required set isn't covered.

## ARCP primitives

- Extension naming `arcpx.<domain>.<name>.v<n>` — RFC §21.1.
- Capability advertisement — §7, §21.2.
- Unknown-message handling, optional vs required — §21.3.
- Artifacts for IQ + PCM — §16.
- `UNIMPLEMENTED` / `NOT_FOUND` — §18.2.

## File tour

- `main.ts` — client side: tune, gain, capture, demodulate, then
  one optional unknown for §21.3.

## Variations

- `arcpx.sdr.spectrum.v1` returning a windowed FFT artifact for
  panadapter UIs.
- Stream demodulated audio as `kind: binary` chunks (sidecar
  frames, §11.3) instead of returning a single artifact.
- Promote `arcpx.sdr.*` to `arcpx.radio.v2` once stabilized; keep
  the v1 namespace working per §21.4.

## Spec ambiguity

§21.3 prescribes optional-vs-required behavior in prose but the
envelope schema does not reserve `extensions.optional`. This example
uses `extensions.optional = true` as the marker.
